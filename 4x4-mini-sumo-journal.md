## 12/15/2025 - Made chassis base, front walls and plate, blade mechanism  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

3D designed the chassis, motor positions, front plate and spring based blade mechanism. This took some time to design the plow mechanism and the mounting solutions as the **size restrictions** a quite a pain.
	I used **Onshape** to model all the parts so far. I've had a bit of trouble fitting everything, however I got it to work in the end.

## 12/16/2025 - Research and Mounting solutions  

_Time spent: 6.0h_  

- Developed mounting solutions for the motors. I chose the 050 motor standard as it delivers good **speed** and **power** for its size. 
- **Researched** distance/opponent sensor options and developed mounting solutions for the current choice: The Jsumo JS40F Digital Distance Sensor. While not the best option, this distance sensor offers good price to performance and allows room for future improvements with better sensors and/or upgraded general elements.
- Cut out space for 2 line sensors witch will detect when the robot is about to leave the ring.

## 12/17/2025 - Modifications/improvements  

_Time spent: 5.5h_  

- Added front and rear blades to prevent pushing and achieve better contact with the ring. The design required some **major changes** to fit the 2 blades as the 100x100mm size limitation requires tight tolerances to maximize space.
- improved wheel protection
- revised spring loaded blade mechanism. 
- adjusted sensor positions to allow for a bigger battery, for now I have chosen a 3 cell LiPo as 12V will suffice for now. A 4 cell battery is an option for future versions.

The current robot only includes 2 front sensors allowing for another 2 diagonal, cross eyed sensors (If i can get them to fit)

Next I need to see which parts I have/can salvage and what I need to order to test the main hinged blade assembly as it is one of the most important parts for this robot to work
  

## 12/18/2025 12 AM - Improved general aspects and added a PCB solutions  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjU3NTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7d5f46583438590c007ad94edaa391cb9c3fe73c/image.png)

- Added possible battery position witch might get altered to fit sensors (ex: gyroscope, motor temperature sensor etc.)
- Improved front protection by extending the front walls to cover the wheels better. This proved to be a **huge pain** as the screw holes moved when any changes were made due to Onshapes handling of sketches.
- added possible PCB mounting position for the **XmotionV3** All In One Controller or the **RedNova V2** Robot Controller Board
I chose these PCBs as they include everything needed (microcontroller, motor drivers, sensor pinouts etc.). However, the RedNova V2 allows for higher voltages and amperages. As such it might be better for this use case.

XmotionV3:

## 12/18/2025 11 PM - Parts list and more sensor options  

_Time spent: 5.0h_  

- after **thorough** research I made a **preliminary** parts list (it will get modified over the next couple days) witch I will add to the GitHub once its done. All same-color parts can be inter swapped **except** the the **Sensor S** (cross-eyed diagonal sensors of witch **at least 2 are needed** in the current design, witch again may be changed). The suppliers in this parts list were carefully chosen based on my personal experience working with (most of) them in the past and promising specifications of their components.

- Found some smaller sensors witch would fit better as cross-eyed, diagonal sensors (Sensor S)

## 12/22/2025 12 AM - Front plate modifications and Lidar resarch  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

- Modified front plate to remove excess material, some might get added back for PCB protection.

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjczMzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--ec3ba8e68466316a87d608b5d39ae46b08f31a9b/image.png)

- Found a very interesting lidar sensor witch would perfectly fit our use case, this lidar is also quite cheap and would add a **significant competitive advantage**. It would replace the 2 cross-eyed sensors witch are currently **out of stock**. Opting for angling the 2 current front sensors to achieve diagonal view. It also possesses an **impressive** specification sheet witch is only accessible on request and took some time to obtain.

## 12/22/2025 2 PM - Preparing for real-world tests  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

- Modified general robot aspects for easier 3D printing and altered front plate to better fit sensors. This was a true challenge as the limited size available for the robot required precise adjustments as to keep protection of the sensors.
- Prepared the 3D printer (general maintenance, filament drying, etc.)
- Imported the 3D models into the slicer.

## 12/22/2025 6 PM - Printed prototype and fitted test parts  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

- Printed and post processed test parts

- Assembled chassis and fitted motors, line sensor and battery (**only for test fitting**, as they have the **wrong performance specs**). I have also found out that I made a small error when making the motor holders and left about 1mm of extra space which I will fix in the next version.

- Tested swinging blade mechanism and test fitted the springs. The springs will need adjustments in the future for a better fit, however, they proved that this design is feasible and has **high potential**.

 I encountered some issues while post processing witch slightly damaged one of the sensor holders, however it hasn't caused any issues in the test fit.
 For now I don't have the right M2 length screws and I had to use what I had on hand. It won't cause any issues for now as this is only a test to ensure we have enough space for all the components.  

## 12/23/2025 - Blade mechanism hardware and design alterations  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

- Modified the blade mechanism to fit 2 springs instead of 1.
- Bent and modified the springs to fit in the plow mechanism. Who knew bending spring steel in such a way as to keep a desired shape wouldn't be that easy? After an annoying amount of abuse towards my fingers I managed to get **both springs** in the desired shape.
- Modified some of the mounting holes to allow press-fitting of the axel on which the springs sit on.

## 12/25/2025 - Code and GitHub  

_Time spent: 10.0h_  

 For code we will use our own custom code witch we have developed over the **past year**. However due to the **high competitive nature** of the **mini sumo competitions** we cannot share it publicly. **We will** release a simpler code in the GitHub based on the XmotionV3 library. This code will allow strategies and precise control of the robot at a professional level as it is quite similar to our old second-place winning code at international competitions.
 I have also made the GitHub with some of the the 3D models, preliminary code and BOM.

## 12/27/2025 6 PM - Line Sensors  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

 To avoid leaving the fighting ring accidentally I have added the 2 line sensors in the design. These will allow for **multiple scenarios** (both sensors see the line, only one etc.).
 I have soldered and tested **multiple options** and settled on some cheap Chinese sensors I had lying around, these offer decent performance while being quite **inexpensive**. Its worth noting that many other teams use these sensors in their robots and their (quite expensive) robot kits and as such, these sensors have become a kind of standard.
 The soldering was a true pain as my soldering iron broke and I had to use a cheap chinese one that barely heats up.

## 12/27/2025 7 PM - Robot Materials  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

 I have researched various materials for the robots chassis and other elements and I have reached the conclusion that all of the parts (apart from the chassis) should be 3D printed ASA/CF-Nylon. The chassis should be made out of a heavier material, to improve the center of gravity. The current **best option** is 3D printed **stainless steel** which JLC3DP has as an option for a quite affordable price (considering the fact that its 3D printed steel).

## 12/28/2025 12 AM - Time of flight sensors  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

 I tested some small time of flight sensors to help fix the space issues however these proved to be too complex for our current design. They might be feasible in the future, I tried for **hours** to connect them. After talking to some of my friends witch go to my local university I found out that they require a special program and a multiplexer to work properly.
 If we could get these sensors to work in the future we would cut down **massively** on the space required.

## 12/28/2025 6 PM - PCB mounting solution  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

 As **multiple** PCB options are available I wont make a fixed method to mount it. Instead I have developed a ingenious solution involving zip tying the PCB to the front walls, this will allow **many** different PCB solutions which will be held by the zip ties and the tension from the existing cables.

## 12/29/2025 2 PM - Added the 2 line sensors  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

- Added the 2 line sensors to the 3D model. I have left quite a large margin of error so other versions of this sensor (different bakeout boards, etc.) fit. In the current design the sensor will be mounted with double sided tape as the sensor is quite light and using the screw holes already provided would be **overkill**.

## 12/29/2025 5 PM - GitHub finalization and Parts  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

I have made the final changes to the GitHub as to abide by all the requirements. This took some time as I haven't really used GitHub and it proved to be quite annoying to learn. I have also added photos of the Jsumo Shopping cart in this journal.

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIwMjUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f30b9ddaba2dc952c3c4f497b55cb5beb3915d4a/image.png)

I can't add photos of shopping carts for the battery (as it is locally sourced) and other small parts as they are scrapped from pens, random hinges, other old projects etc. However I included all of them in the BOM (I don't think i forgot anything)
