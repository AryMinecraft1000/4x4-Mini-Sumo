# 4x4-Mini-Sumo
A 4x4 mini sumo robot to fit in the 10x10cm, 500g class.
I chose this design philosophy as I've built 2 wheel drive international competition winning robots before and I wanted to challenge myself with the added complexity and space restrictions of a 4x4 robot. I also want to use this design to compete im my local international competition this spring.

I'd like to note that this is **NOT a battlebot**, its a far **more complex** robot witch uses sensors and **advanced code** to execute its task (Unlike battlebots which are just rc cars with weapons). It is part of one of the most competitive classes in international robotics where the top robots cost well over 1000$.

The Jsumo PCB has wiring intructions written on it.
